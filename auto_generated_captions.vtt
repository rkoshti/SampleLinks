00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:06.985
Okay guys.

1
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.265
So today we're gonna make, um, so we're gonna make paprika,

2
00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.905
chips, so smoked paprika, tortilla chips,

3
00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:13.905
and we're also gonna combine

4
00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:14.985
them with a little bit of salsa.

5
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.745
So again, really rich in antioxidants, this recipe, um,

6
00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.585
a wonderful way to include some

7
00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.105
anti-inflammatory properties as well.

8
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.345
So we'll talk you down through all the health benefits

9
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:25.345
that come with all the

10
00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:26.745
ingredients that we're gonna use today.

11
00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:30.105
So again, to kickstart, we're gonna preheat our air fryer,

12
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:34.345
so kicking it on 200 degrees, sorry, 180 degrees,

13
00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.145
not 200 degrees, because we'll be frying, uh,

14
00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.305
frying our pit, our pit of chips.

15
00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:41.665
So first of all, we're gonna start with our salsa.

16
00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.465
So taking two tomatoes and we're gonna chop

17
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:48.545
them up nice and nice.

18
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.225
And finally, so that we are going

19
00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.105
to have a nice consistency.

20
00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.745
Again, if you want to use tinned tomatoes here, either, um,

21
00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:57.825
it might be quicker, save you more time,

22
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.665
but today we are using some nice ripe

23
00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.065
fresh plumped tomatoes.

24
00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:05.505
Um, so we're coming into the summer season, so again,

25
00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.905
we're getting really, really good nutrient quality coming in

26
00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.025
through our tomatoes that we're getting.

27
00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:13.865
Um, also thinking about all the antioxidant properties

28
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:14.945
that come with tomatoes.

29
00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:18.625
So really rich in something called lysine

30
00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:21.585
and lysine again, helps with overall heart health

31
00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:23.265
and helping to maintain your blood sugar.

32
00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:26.705
Um, also we've got potassium, which helps

33
00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:28.545
with the fluid balance within your cells.

34
00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:30.465
So tomatoes are a wonderful thing

35
00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.585
to include in your diet if you're trying

36
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.665
to regulate your overall water balance in your body.

37
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.745
Um, thinking about your electrolytes, um,

38
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.825
if you're quite sporty, again, really, really good

39
00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.145
to include these in your diet

40
00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:46.025
to help balance out your overall sodium

41
00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:47.345
potassium concentrations.

42
00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:51.305
Okay. Um, also thinking about the vitamin C

43
00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:52.585
content in tomatoes.

44
00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.745
So vitamin C is really, really, um, good for helping

45
00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:57.545
to absorb iron in your diet.

46
00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:59.585
So combining that with say, chicken

47
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.665
or Turkey fish, again, really good sources of iron,

48
00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.345
but tomato will help you absorb the iron from them.

49
00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.705
If you're a vegetarian or a vegan, the iron

50
00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:12.105
that you're gonna be getting in your diet isn't

51
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.785
as easily absorbed by the body.

52
00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:16.865
It's non-heme, iron. Iron is what it's called.

53
00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:21.305
So vitamin C really helps at absorbing the iron from non

54
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.785
plant or non-animal based sources of protein.

55
00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:29.345
Okay, so again, you don't have to be too perfectionist about

56
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:30.545
how you chop up your tomatoes.

57
00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:33.785
Again, they're all gonna just go into your salsas and nice

58
00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:34.985
and small and fine,

59
00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:37.185
but again, they can be a bit messy at the same time.

60
00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:37.905
Okay.

61
00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:47.745
If you're not great at staying hydrated tomatoes, again,

62
00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:51.465
any kind of juicy, um, high liquid based fruit

63
00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.785
or vegetables can also help with your overall,

64
00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:55.185
uh, hydration levels.

65
00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:58.065
So including them in your diet if you're not great at

66
00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:00.165
staying on top of your, your water content

67
00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.045
intake, uh, during the day.

68
00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.685
Okay. Once you've got them nice

69
00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.325
and finally diced up here, we're gonna pop them in a bowl.

70
00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:12.055
So add them into our big mixing bowl here

71
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.655
and we're gonna take our garlic then.

72
00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:27.255
So two little cloves of garlic

73
00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:28.975
and we're gonna grate that into our bowl.

74
00:03:29.755 --> 00:03:32.735
So garlic, really rich in something called Allison

75
00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:37.415
and Allison helps with your overall, um,

76
00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:39.415
antioxidant properties,

77
00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.455
but it also widens your blood prep blood vessels so

78
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.335
that your blood can flow a little bit more freely.

79
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.295
So again, promoting good heart health.

80
00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:50.975
Okay, no one likes working with garlic,

81
00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:53.615
always leaves your hands smelly.

82
00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:57.535
So do have a nice anti back near you if you can,

83
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:00.015
or again, using lemon juice or lime juice

84
00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:03.335
after grading, the garlic will help to combat the,

85
00:04:03.595 --> 00:04:06.135
the lingering pungent smell that comes with,

86
00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:09.015
okay, grading that in there.

87
00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:11.695
It's quite a strong flavor off it.

88
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.095
So if you find that one clove is enough for you,

89
00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:17.215
if you don't like too much garlic, that is perfectly fine.

90
00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:21.335
We're gonna add two in here. Again,

91
00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:30.895
really, really versatile as well as a herb.

92
00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:35.055
So again, you can make your own homemade garlic bread, um,

93
00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:38.415
adding it into any kind of dishes, pasta dishes

94
00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:39.895
as well helps you bring up the flavor

95
00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:41.895
and all the other food in your diet as well.

96
00:04:43.645 --> 00:04:47.095
It's antibacterial as well. So really, really good.

97
00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:51.335
If you do find that you tend to pick up cold flus

98
00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:53.135
or illnesses or anything like that, it does help

99
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.735
to keep your immune system nice and strong.

100
00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:03.015
Okay, Say it again.

101
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:05.815
Hair fry is preheated and it's letting me know.

102
00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:09.215
Um, we've got our vitamin C then coming in

103
00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:10.215
through our lime juice.

104
00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:12.015
I can add that into our salsa.

105
00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:18.765
I'm gonna use a whole lime here as well just to bring up

106
00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:20.845
as much flavor in the tomatoes

107
00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:22.565
and get everything uh, kicking.

108
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:26.445
You'll find that acid base as well help to kind

109
00:05:26.445 --> 00:05:29.325
of bring up the nutrients in the other, uh,

110
00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:32.125
nutrient compounds in the other foods that you're including.

111
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:35.365
So we've got our onion again, adding in this rich source

112
00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:37.525
of El Flavanols plant flavanols,

113
00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:39.445
um, cetin being one of them.

114
00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:41.445
Okay, so we're gonna mix that all together there.

115
00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:45.605
Now you can see nice blend

116
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.805
and then we're gonna add in some coriander.

117
00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:52.285
So coriander again really helps boost the enzymes in your

118
00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.525
body, which help to balance your blood sugar levels

119
00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:56.165
or control your blood sugar levels.

120
00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:58.645
Okay, so again, another lovely herb

121
00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:02.205
to include in your overall, um, in your overall diet.

122
00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:04.925
So just to bring up the flavor again,

123
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:07.205
we're gonna add a little bit of black pepper in all the

124
00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:09.645
antioxidant properties that come with black pepper too,

125
00:06:10.185 --> 00:06:11.525
um, and salt as well.

126
00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:14.525
So with pepper, again, it's a really good source

127
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:15.845
of vitamin K vitamin

128
00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:18.285
and vitamin K is really good at boosting your bo

129
00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:19.965
or it's helping with your bone health.

130
00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:22.045
Okay? So it helps with your bone

131
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:24.445
and production of osteoblasts.

132
00:06:24.595 --> 00:06:26.645
Osteoblasts helps with the building of your bones.

133
00:06:27.105 --> 00:06:28.285
So again, something really,

134
00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:29.325
really good to include in your diet.

135
00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:32.085
Easy to access always on every table.

136
00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.365
So something to include

137
00:06:34.425 --> 00:06:36.405
to help boost the nutrient absorption

138
00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:37.605
from all your other foods.

139
00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:40.205
Again, just to keep in mind,

140
00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:42.485
we have loads more recipes like this on our app.

141
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:44.525
So head out to the academy section on our app,

142
00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:46.765
have a little look and see what else is available there.

143
00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:48.325
Okay, so we're just gonna tip

144
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.365
this into our little bowl here.

145
00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.925
So we've got our salsa ready to go,

146
00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:56.565
and then we're gonna start toasting our, um, pity chips.

147
00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.845
Okay, so we're gonna start with our pity chips now.

148
00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:01.485
So I'm gonna keep calling them pity chips.

149
00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:02.765
You can call them tortilla chips,

150
00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.125
call 'em whatever you wanna call them.

151
00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:06.205
Nachos. Oh,

152
00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.925
I think pity chips sounds a little bit healthier.

153
00:07:07.945 --> 00:07:09.765
So we've got two little mini wraps.

154
00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:12.205
Again, we're gonna put them one on top of the other

155
00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:14.725
and we're gonna spritz them with olive oil.

156
00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:17.685
Olive oil, again, really good for your heart health.

157
00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:21.925
Really good for anti-inflammatory purposes.

158
00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:26.725
So if you tend to suffer with tight muscles, sore muscles,

159
00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:28.565
sore limbs, anything like that,

160
00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.165
and a little bit of extra olive oil into your diet.

161
00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:34.165
Dry skin, again, really good to help, um,

162
00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:37.205
with your overall lubrication is what we'll say.

163
00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:40.085
So we're gonna put our two little pit of pit of breads

164
00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.485
or two little tortilla wraps on top of each other

165
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:43.805
and we're gonna cut them into four.

166
00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:45.685
Okay, so into quarters.

167
00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:48.645
Then we're gonna turn our board

168
00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:50.365
and again, cut them into,

169
00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:52.525
cut them in half, cut them into a quarter.

170
00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:57.645
Careful they don't slide down yet.

171
00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:00.005
And then you're gonna cut them into your eights

172
00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:01.725
so you can start to see we're getting our nice little

173
00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:06.325
triangles, like our nachos appearing here.

174
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:13.445
Okay. And we're gonna take

175
00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:14.605
our spice.

176
00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:17.765
So we've got paprika, nice little kick again,

177
00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:20.005
you can use any spice you want to use here.

178
00:08:20.265 --> 00:08:22.405
So you could use nutritional yeast again

179
00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:24.165
to bring up your B 12 levels.

180
00:08:24.185 --> 00:08:28.085
If you're vegan or vegetarian, you could use orano.

181
00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:30.325
Um, you could do Italian mixed herbs.

182
00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:35.125
Um, you could do whatever you like, occasion chili

183
00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:39.605
or even just a cracked black pepper and salt nacho.

184
00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:42.805
Okay? And maybe even get adventurous

185
00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:44.685
and make it a little bit sweet and add some cinnamon.

186
00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:46.885
So again, you're just gonna turn them all over.

187
00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:50.165
Adding your little sprinkle of paprika.

188
00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:56.565
Again, paprika really rich in those

189
00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:57.965
anti-inflammatory properties.

190
00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:01.325
So all these herbs and spices, it's fantastic to think

191
00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:02.885
that they're so easy to access.

192
00:09:02.945 --> 00:09:04.645
You can pick them up in any supermarket

193
00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:06.365
and keep them in your cupboard there.

194
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:09.605
And you have access to those medicinal properties,

195
00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:13.285
plant-based medicinal properties, um, at your hand.

196
00:09:13.715 --> 00:09:14.005
Okay?

197
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.125
You'll see they're nicely coated there, ready to go.

198
00:09:25.345 --> 00:09:28.205
And then we're just gonna lay them into our air fryer.

199
00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:30.045
So our air fryer is preheated,

200
00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:31.885
and what we're gonna do again,

201
00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:33.765
is just grease the bottom of it.

202
00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:36.845
So we are gonna just take our spray oil.

203
00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:39.285
Again, spray oils are great if you're trying

204
00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.365
to manage your overall energy intake, maintain

205
00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.685
or balance your weight as, as per se.

206
00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:46.965
Um, because you get a nice little dash

207
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:50.045
and a little goes a long way when it comes to oils as well.

208
00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:53.285
So we're just gonna lay them all out in our basket. Okay?

209
00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:55.765
So you'll see that we're just, we don't want them touching.

210
00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:57.525
If they end up touching

211
00:09:57.525 --> 00:09:59.965
or layering, they mightn't get the full crispiness

212
00:10:00.115 --> 00:10:01.885
that you're meant to get with your air fryers.

213
00:10:01.885 --> 00:10:04.325
You, you'll find that they are a little bit soggy,

214
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:05.965
a little bit limp and lifeless looking.

215
00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:13.005
Again, you might have to do two rounds,

216
00:10:13.005 --> 00:10:16.485
so you might get them all cooked in the one go, but try

217
00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:17.565
and space them out nice and

218
00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:19.245
evenly in the base of your basket.

219
00:10:19.475 --> 00:10:20.475
Okay?

220
00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:24.725
Okay. And we're gonna pop 'em in here then for

221
00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:29.045
between 10 and 12 minutes again.

222
00:10:33.385 --> 00:10:35.005
And we're rolling. We'll pop these in

223
00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:36.325
when the other ones are done.

224
00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:37.525
So we're gonna turn them halfway.

225
00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:40.605
So six minutes in, flip them over so

226
00:10:40.605 --> 00:10:42.765
that both sides get nicely, co nicely toasted,

227
00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.525
and then we'll pop these ones in when they're done.

228
00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:47.405
Okay? So there's a great smile kicking.

229
00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:48.645
So we're gonna take them out now

230
00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:50.285
and we're gonna flip them halfway through.

231
00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.685
Okay? So just making sure that they're all nicely turned so

232
00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.965
that everything is getting toasted okay?

233
00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:58.165
Until they're gonna be yummy as well.

234
00:10:58.165 --> 00:10:59.885
There's a lovely crisp, um, scent.

235
00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:02.565
Okay, so back in for another few.

236
00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:04.645
Okay, so they're finished now.

237
00:11:04.695 --> 00:11:06.725
Plate it up, ready to take a chip and dip.

238
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.565
Um, again, a lovely nice summary snack to have.
